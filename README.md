# React-Blog
I made this app to learn more about React, and i putted to use what i learn for the back-end, with out knowing, i used a MERN stack.

to start the app, you have to run
`
npm run dev
`
 on the client side and on the server side

to mess around with the tailwindcss run on the client side
`
npm run buildCss
`
